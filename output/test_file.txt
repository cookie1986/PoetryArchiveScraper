Read the poem text 






Three poems from 'Figure in a Landscape'. The first of these, 'Trunk of fig tree from Ses Rossells', has the following note from the author: "In this poem there is a reference to the heroine of a Russian fairytale called 'Vassilissa the Beautiful'."










From ‘Figure in a Landscape’ (5)

Trunk of fig tree from Ses Rossells 
This tree is a grey-faced woman	who struggles to her feet, one arm	a broken branch hanging useless	The wild fire on the hill	you have escaped for now	but you are tinder-dry this summer	Terracing lies tumbled around you
Earlier we stood in the gloom of the cave	wondering why we had come	Inside, the usual debris	human excrement, tissues, rusting tins	a goat’s skeleton picked clean by ants	blackened stones of a makeshift hearth	To please our father, find his fabled cave	we had scrambled over boulders	cut ourselves on razor-grass	and now your arm is broken	Two daughters in their fifties	still trying to prove	they are as good as the sons he wanted
We should have followed the example of Vassilissa	borne the goat skull home	and let the darkness in its sockets	blaze our rage, burn down the house
 
 
Fig tree at Son Ramonet Gros 
What is it you hear?	Poised on one foot	you’re about to convene	a residents’ meeting	clean the pool	walk the dog	cook for the parents, but	something just off to the left	tugs, and you lean	distracted by this sound	as by a strange	beat in the car’s engine	a thudding in the ears	Please do not listen	Pay it no heed	It is only the three o’clock wind	the wind in the cypresses you hear
 
 
Fig trees in front of Can Cabana 
their green skirts making tents of shade	in a field of shimmering wheat. Surprised	among it like creatures of another life—	secret, mysterious, just glimpsed amid	the daily plainness of grain—the pulsing pink	of wild gladiolus and poppies’ blood-red	drinking deep of the fig trees’ shade
